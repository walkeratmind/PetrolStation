# Petrol Station

------

- shows the nearby petrol stations based on google maps API other petrol stations added by user.
- shows the direction of stations from user's current location.
- used web scarping to get current gas prices of nepal using web scarping (as I didn't find any API for getting price, I had to scarp the data). 
- build admin page for this app to add stations and places manually. link to the admin page is (here)[https://github.com/walkeratmind/petrol_station-admin]
- stores data in firebase permanently and supports offline too as data is cached in sqlite for offline.
